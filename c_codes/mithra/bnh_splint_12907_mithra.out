# Unix IDL executes bnh_splint_12907_mithra.sh to
# build the sharable library. Any errors produced in that process
# are redirected to this file. In reading this file, please be
# aware that some loaders, such as the Solaris ld(1), will produce
# errors for symbols not resolved while building the library. Such
# errors are normal, as a sharable library usually cannot be
# completely resolved until runtime, and are normally not a
# cause for concern. The missing symbols are resolved at runtime
# when IDL loads the library.
#
# Any output resulting from this process appears after the next line
